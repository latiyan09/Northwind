-- Question 5
The Pricing Team wants to know which products had an unit price increase and 
the percentage increase was not between 20% and 30%. In order to help them they 
asked you to provide them a list of products with:

1. their product name
2. their current unit price (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
3. their previous unit price (formatted to have only 2 decimals)
4. their percentage increase as:
(New Number - Original Number) รท Original Number ร 100 
(with the result formatted to an integer, e.g 50 for 50%)

Filtered on the following conditions:

1. their percentage increase is not between 20% and 30%
2. their total number of orders is greater than 10 orders
Finally order the results by percentage increase (ascending order).
