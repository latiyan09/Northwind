-- Question 4
The Logistics Team wants to do a retrospection of their global performances over 1997-1998, 
in order to identify for which month they perform well. They asked you to provide them a list with:

1. their year/month as single field in a date format (e.g. “1996-01-01” January 1996)
2. their total number of orders
3. their total freight (formatted to have no decimals)

Filtered on the following conditions:
1. the order date is between 1997 and 1998
2. their total number of orders is greater than 35 orders 

Finally order the results by total freight (descending order).
